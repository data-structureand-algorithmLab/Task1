# Task1

Recursion features
There must be a base.
That is, a certain value of a parameter in which there will be no further call to function.
(No basis - the function will never end).
Each function call is in the lower or higher order and brings the recursion closer to the base.
How to write recursion?
Assume that the function knows how to perform the action required for one lower order.
Rely on the ability of the function to perform the operation for one lower order (order n-1) and
perform the n step.
Create the base conditions (beyond which the function will stop calling itself)
Task 1:
Write a method that receives an integer and returns the factorial calculation of the received
number.
Such as: The given number is: 5
 The value returned will be: 5! = 5*4*3*2*1= 120
